I made this as a tutorial project. 

Changes that I made: 

- Add the words functionality to the options checkboxes
- Adjust the input element to a textarea element to allow for dynamic adjustment of the height of the textarea when text overflows.

Originally this project was just static HTML, CSS, and Javscript. I adjusted the project for ReactJS + Vite.
